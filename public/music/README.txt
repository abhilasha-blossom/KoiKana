# Lo-fi Radio Music

The Lo-fi Radio feature expects the following music files in this directory:

- `peaceful.mp3`
- `traditional.mp3`
- `lofi_placeholder.mp3` (or any other chill track)

## How to add your own music:
1. Place your `.mp3` files here.
2. Rename them to match the above, or update `src/components/RadioPlayer.jsx` to point to your new files.
